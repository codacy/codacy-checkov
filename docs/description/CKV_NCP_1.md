# Checkov Security Check: CKV_NCP_16

## Overview
This Checkov security check, identified as `CKV_NCP_16`, is designed to identify a specific security issue where a Load Balancer is exposed to the internet. The purpose of this check is to ensure that the Load Balancer is configured to operate in a private network type.

## Security Issue
The security issue this check identifies is a misconfiguration of the network type for a Load Balancer. Specifically, it checks to ensure that the Load Balancer is not operating in a public network type, hence exposed to the internet. 

Exposing a Load Balancer to the internet can lead to a range of security vulnerabilities. For instance, it may be open to unauthorized access or attacks from malicious entities. This could potentially compromise the data and applications that are being balanced by the Load Balancer.

## Security Importance
From a security perspective, ensuring that the Load Balancer operates in a private network type is essential. It helps in limiting the surface area for attacks by restricting access to the Load Balancer. This, in turn, protects the integrity and confidentiality of the data and applications managed by the Load Balancer.

## How to Fix the Issue
To fix this issue, you should configure the `network_type` of the Load Balancer to `PRIVATE`. This ensures that the Load Balancer is only accessible within the defined private network and not exposed to the wider internet. 

Here's a simple example of how to set the `network_type` to `PRIVATE` in your Terraform configuration:

```
resource "ncloud_lb" "example" {
  network_type = "PRIVATE"
  # Other configuration details...
}
```

Remember, always review your network configurations and apply the principle of least privilege. This principle states that a subject should be given only those privileges that it needs to complete its tasks, in order to minimize the potential damage from a breach.
