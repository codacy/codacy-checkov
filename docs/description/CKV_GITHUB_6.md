# Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_6

## What does this check do?

The security check `CKV_GITHUB_6` ensures that GitHub organization webhooks are using HTTPS.

Webhooks are a way for applications to communicate between each other automatically. For example, GitHub can notify your server whenever a certain event occurs.

This security check scans the configuration of your GitHub organization's webhooks. It specifically checks for two things:

1. It verifies that the URL of your webhook is using HTTPS and not HTTP.
2. It checks that the 'insecure_ssl' option is not enabled and that the 'secret' value is not default or empty.

## Why is this check important?

Using HTTPS in webhooks is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Data integrity**: HTTPS ensures the data sent from GitHub to your server hasn't been tampered with during transit.
2. **Confidentiality**: HTTPS encrypts the data during transit. This is especially important if your webhooks transmit sensitive data.
3. **Authentication**: HTTPS verifies that your server is communicating with GitHub and not an imposter.

Having 'insecure_ssl' enabled or not having a proper secret value can lead to potential man-in-the-middle attacks. This can allow attackers to intercept or manipulate the data sent via the webhook.

## How to fix the issues this check might find?

To fix any issues found by this check:

1. **Use HTTPS**: Ensure that your webhook's URL starts with `https://`.
2. **Disable 'insecure_ssl'**: In your webhook's configuration, make sure the 'insecure_ssl' option is set to '0'.
3. **Set a secret**: Generate a secure, random string and set it as the 'secret' in your webhook's configuration. This secret should be kept confidential.

By doing these, you can make sure your GitHub organization's webhooks are secure.
