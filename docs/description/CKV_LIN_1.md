# Checkov Security Check - CKV_LIN_1

## Issue Identified

This security check, "CKV_LIN_1", is designed to identify any instances where Linode tokens (API keys) are hard-coded directly into the provider configuration in Terraform scripts. Hard-coding credentials is a common misconfiguration that can lead to security vulnerabilities.

The specific function `scan_provider_conf` scans the provider configuration (`conf`) for a field labeled "token" that matches the pattern of a Linode token (as defined in `linode_token_pattern`). If such a token is found, the check fails.

## Importance from a Security Perspective

Hard-coded credentials, such as Linode tokens, are a significant security risk. If an attacker gains access to the source code, they could retrieve these tokens and gain unauthorized access to the associated Linode resources, which could include sensitive or critical data and services.

Furthermore, hard-coded credentials violate the principle of least privilege, which mandates that a process should have only the minimal privileges it needs to function. They also make credential rotation, a best practice for secure credential management, difficult or impossible.

## How to Fix the Issue

To address this issue, avoid hard-coding secrets like Linode tokens directly into your Terraform scripts. Instead, leverage secure methods for managing secrets:

- **Environment Variables**: Store your Linode tokens as environment variables on the system where your scripts are being run. You can then reference these environment variables in your scripts.

- **Terraform Vault Provider**: The Vault provider for Terraform allows you to securely store and manage sensitive data, like Linode tokens.

- **Linode Credential File**: Store your Linode tokens in a credential file that is not committed to source control. You can then reference this file in your scripts.

Remember to utilize appropriate access controls and encryption for any method you choose to store your secrets. 

By following these remediation steps, you can ensure that your Linode tokens are not exposed, thereby maintaining the security and integrity of your Linode resources.
