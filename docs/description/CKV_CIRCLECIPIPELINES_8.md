# Detecting image usages in circleci pipelines

_This pattern description was written by a Codacy bot for Checkov. Send feedback to ai-patterns@codacy.com_

## Explanation

The provided Checkov security check is called `DetectImageUsage`. This check is designed to identify and report instances where Docker images are being used within CircleCI pipelines. 

### Security Issue or Misconfiguration

The specific security issue or misconfiguration this check identifies is the use of Docker images within the CircleCI pipeline. This is important because Docker images can contain vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited when the image is run in a pipeline. 

### Security Perspective

From a security perspective, this issue matters because if an attacker is able to exploit a vulnerability in a Docker image, they could potentially gain unauthorized access to the system, disrupt operations, or even steal sensitive information. In addition, since the pipeline may have access to production environments, a compromised Docker image can potentially lead to serious security incidents.

### Fixing the Issue

To fix this issue, it is recommended to:

1. Regularly update the Docker images used in the CircleCI pipeline to ensure they include the latest security patches.
2. Only use Docker images from trusted sources.
3. Conduct regular security audits of the Docker images used in the pipeline, either manually or using automated tools.
4. Implement Docker image scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline to detect and fix vulnerabilities before the images are deployed.

Keep in mind that the current implementation of `DetectImageUsage` check returns a `CheckResult.PASSED` regardless of the configuration passed to it. To make this check useful, you might need to implement the actual logic for scanning the provided configuration and return `CheckResult.FAILED` if the detected Docker image usage is deemed a security risk.
