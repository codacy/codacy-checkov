## Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_12

### Overview

This security check, identified as `CKV_GITHUB_12`, is designed to ensure that GitHub branch protection restricts who can dismiss pull request (PR) reviews. 

### Security Issue

The security issue that this check identifies is the lack of restrictions on who can dismiss PR reviews. In GitHub, it's possible to enforce certain restrictions on actions that contributors can take on a PR. One of these actions is the dismissal of PR reviews, which can be a problem if there are no restrictions in place.

If a team member, contributor, or external actor who has gained inappropriate access to your repository can freely dismiss PR reviews, it can lead to unauthorized code being merged into the project. This may introduce security vulnerabilities, bugs, or other issues into the production environment.

### Why this Issue Matters

From a security perspective, this issue is significant because it can lead to the compromise of your codebase and potentially your entire production environment. 

If PR reviews can be dismissed by anyone, a malicious actor could dismiss negative reviews that highlight security vulnerabilities or other issues, and then proceed to merge their changes. This could lead to an array of issues, including data leaks, privilege escalation, or the execution of unauthorized code.

### How to Fix the Issue

To fix this issue, you need to establish dismissal restrictions on PR reviews. This can be done in the settings for your GitHub repository.

Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Click on "Settings" in the menu.
3. Click on "Branches" in the left side menu.
4. Under "Branch protection rules", click "Add rule" or edit an existing rule.
5. In the "Protect matching branches" section, check the box for "Require pull request reviews before merging".
6. In the "Dismissal restrictions" section, specify the individuals or teams that are allowed to dismiss pull request reviews.
7. Click on "Create" or "Save changes" to enforce the rule.

By implementing these restrictions, you can ensure that only authorized individuals can dismiss PR reviews, enhancing the security and integrity of your codebase.
