# Checkov Security Check: Prevent Usage of Unversioned Volatile Orbs (CKV_CIRCLECIPIPELINES_4)

This security check identifies a specific misconfiguration related to the use of orbs in CircleCI pipeline configurations. 

## Security Issue/Misconfiguration

CircleCI orbs are reusable pieces of configuration that can save you time and simplify your build, test, and deploy processes. However, this check identifies the usage of **unversioned volatile orbs**. Unversioned orbs are those which are not tied to a specific version and instead use the `@volatile` tag.

## Importance from a Security Perspective

From a security perspective, the usage of unversioned volatile orbs can pose significant risks. Since these orbs are not tied to a specific version, they can change without notice. This means that the behavior of your CI/CD pipeline may change unexpectedly, potentially introducing bugs, breaking the build process, or even introducing security vulnerabilities if the orb is maliciously modified.

For instance, if a developer uses unversioned orbs, an attacker who gains control over the orb can introduce malicious code. This code is then executed in the CI/CD pipeline, potentially compromising the security of the application and the entire pipeline.

## Fixing the Issue

To fix this issue, ensure that all orbs used in your CircleCI pipeline are versioned. Instead of using the `@volatile` tag, specify a version number. This guarantees that the orb will behave as expected. 

Specifically, in the orb declaration in your CircleCI configuration file (`.circleci/config.yml`), replace lines like this:

```yaml
orbs:
  some-orb: namespace/orb@volatile
```

with lines like this:

```yaml
orbs:
  some-orb: namespace/orb@1.2.3
```

Remember to replace `1.2.3` with the intended version of the orb. 

This change will make your CircleCI pipelines more predictable and secure, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior or security issues.
