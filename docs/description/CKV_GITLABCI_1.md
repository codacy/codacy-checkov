## Checkov Security Check - CKV_GITLABCI_1

### Overview
This security check, identified as "CKV_GITLABCI_1", is part of a suite of checks provided by Checkov - a static code analysis tool for infrastructure as code (IaC). Specifically, this check addresses a potential security issue related to the use of `curl` with GitLab CI environment variables in scripts.

### Security Issue
The check identifies a specific security concern where the `curl` command is used alongside GitLab CI environment variables within a script. GitLab CI environment variables often contain sensitive information such as secrets, tokens, and keys. Misuse of these variables, particularly with commands like `curl`, could lead to unintended data exposure or leakage.

This could be particularly dangerous if the `curl` command were used to make a request to an insecure or malicious site, or if it were used to transmit sensitive data, as it could potentially expose these sensitive environment variables to third parties.

### Why This Issue Matters
This issue is significant from a security perspective because it concerns the potential exposure of sensitive data. If malicious actors gain access to these environment variables, they could potentially gain unauthorized access to systems or services, leading to data breaches or other security incidents.

In addition, non-compliance with best practices for handling sensitive information could lead to regulatory issues, particularly for organizations under strict data handling and privacy regulations.

### How to Fix This Issue
To address this issue, avoid using the `curl` command with GitLab CI environment variables in script. If it is necessary to use `curl` to fetch or send data, ensure that the target URL is secure and trusted. 

As a good practice, consider using secret management tools or services to handle sensitive data. This can provide an additional layer of security by encrypting the data and controlling who has access to it. 

Lastly, always follow the principle of least privilege when working with CI/CD pipelines and scripts. This means giving each part of the system the minimum levels of access needed to perform its function. This can help to limit the potential damage if a particular component is compromised.
