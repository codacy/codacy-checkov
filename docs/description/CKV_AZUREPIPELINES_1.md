# Checkov Security Check: CKV_AZUREPIPELINES_1 - ContainerLatestTag 

## What This Check Does

The `ContainerLatestTag` security check ensures that the jobs in Azure Pipelines are not using the `latest` tag for container images. The `latest` tag is a default Docker tag that is often used to tag the most recent image build. 

This check first identifies if the `jobs` or `stages[].jobs[]` that are part of the Azure Pipelines configuration are using a container. If yes, it checks whether the used container image is tagged as `latest` or not. If the image is tagged as `latest` or if there is no tag at all, the check fails.

## Why This Check Matters

Using the `latest` tag in production can lead to unpredictable behaviors because the `latest` tag doesn't refer to the 'latest' version of the image in the semantic versioning sense, but rather the 'last' built. 

This means that pulling a `latest` image at different times can result in different versions of the software being deployed. This can lead to inconsistent behaviors and make it difficult to track which version of the application is running in your environment. 

Moreover, an attacker might be able to push a malicious image tagged as `latest` to your image repository. If your deployments are pulling the `latest` image, they could inadvertently pull and run the malicious image.

## How to Fix This Issue

The fix for this issue is to avoid using the `latest` tag in your Azure Pipelines configuration. You should always use a specific version number for your Docker images. 

In the configuration for `jobs` or `stages[].jobs[]`, replace the `latest` tag with a specific version tag. For example, if you're using a Python image, instead of using `python:latest`, use a specific version like `python:3.8.5`. 

This ensures that you always know exactly which version of the software is being used in your environment, leading to more predictable behavior and increased security.
