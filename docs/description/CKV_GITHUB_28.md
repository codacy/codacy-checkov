## Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_28

### Overview
This Checkov security check, identified as "CKV_GITHUB_28", is designed to ensure that a GitHub organization's identity is confirmed with a Verified badge. The check is focused on the `is_verified` attribute of a GitHub organization.

### Security Issue
The security issue this check identifies is the lack of verification for a GitHub organization. In other words, it checks whether the organization has a Verified badge, which confirms the organization's identity. If an organization's identity is not verified, it raises potential security concerns. 

Unverified organizations may not be who they claim to be, which can lead to phishing attacks, identity theft, or other types of fraudulent activities. Therefore, from a security perspective, it is crucial to ensure that any GitHub organization is properly verified.

### How to Fix the Issue
To address this issue, you need to verify your organization's identity on GitHub. This can be done by following these steps:

1. Go to your GitHub organization's settings.
2. In the left sidebar, click on "Profile."
3. Next to "Organization verification," click "Start the verification process."
4. Follow the instructions provided by GitHub to verify your organization.

Once the organization's identity is verified, it will receive a Verified badge. This verifies that the organization is who it claims to be, reducing potential security risks and enhancing trust and credibility.
