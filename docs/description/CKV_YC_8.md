# Checkov Security Check: K8SNodeGroupAutoUpgrade (CKV_YC_8)

## Issue Identified:

This Checkov security check, titled 'K8SNodeGroupAutoUpgrade', specifically identifies whether the auto-upgrade feature is enabled for Kubernetes node groups in Yandex Cloud. The inspection key `maintenance_policy/[0]/auto_upgrade` is used to determine if auto-upgrade is enabled or not.

The forbidden values for this check are `[False]`. This means that if the `auto_upgrade` feature is set to `False`, the check will fail.

## Security Importance:

From a security perspective, keeping software and systems updated is crucial. Updates often include patches for known vulnerabilities, which if left unpatched, could be exploited by attackers. 

In the context of Kubernetes, nodes can be a prime target for attackers. Therefore, ensuring that Kubernetes node groups are automatically upgraded is vital. This helps in maintaining the latest security features and updates, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.

## Resolution:

To fix this issue and pass the 'K8SNodeGroupAutoUpgrade' check, you should ensure that the auto-upgrade feature is enabled for your Kubernetes node groups in Yandex Cloud. This can be done by setting the `auto_upgrade` key to `True` in the `maintenance_policy` section of your Yandex Kubernetes node group configuration.

Here's an example:

```yaml
resource "yandex_kubernetes_node_group" "example" {
  ...
  maintenance_policy {
    auto_upgrade = true
  }
  ...
}
```

By setting `auto_upgrade` to `True`, your Kubernetes node groups will automatically receive updates, helping to keep your systems secure.
