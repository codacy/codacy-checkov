## Checkov Security Check: CKV_YC_21

### Description

The `CKV_YC_21` check, also known as `IAMOrganizationElevatedMembers`, is designed to identify if any member in an organization has been granted elevated access. 

This security check focuses on the following resources in Yandex.Cloud: 

- `yandex_organizationmanager_organization_iam_binding`
- `yandex_organizationmanager_organization_iam_member`

### Security Risk

The main security concern that this check addresses is the principle of least privilege (PoLP). This principle, a fundamental tenet of information security, stipulates that users should be granted the least amount of privileges necessary to complete their job function. This is crucial to minimize the potential damage done by user errors, offsite attacks, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

If an organization member is given elevated access (such as admin, editor, or owner roles), they have the ability to make significant changes to the organization's resources. This can lead to serious security issues like data breaches or service disruptions if the account is misused or compromised.

### How to Fix

To fix this issue, you should review the roles assigned to each user in your Yandex.Cloud organization and ensure that they only have the privileges necessary to perform their tasks. 

Specifically, the following roles should be avoided unless absolutely necessary:

- `admin`
- `editor`
- `organization-manager.organizations.owner`
- `organization-manager.admin`

You can use the Yandex.Cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management) console or APIs to manage user roles and permissions. 

If a user needs temporary elevated access for a specific task, consider using a just-in-time privileges model where the higher access is granted for a limited time and then automatically revoked.

By following the principle of least privilege, you can reduce the risk of unauthorized actions in your Yandex.Cloud environment and maintain a robust security posture.
