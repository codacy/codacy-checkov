# Checkov Security Check: Suspicious use of netcat with IP address

## Description
This security check, identified as `CKV_CIRCLECIPIPELINES_5`, searches for suspicious use of the `netcat` or `nc` command with an IP address in the configuration of CircleCI pipelines. 

## The Security Issue
The `netcat` command is a networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. It's extremely useful for scripting and debugging network services. However, `netcat` can also be used maliciously to create reverse shells, essentially opening a backdoor into a system.

A reverse shell is a type of shell in which the target machine communicates back to the attacking machine. The attacking machine has a listener port on which it receives the connection, which by using `netcat` or `nc` can be a fully interactive shell. 

In this check, the code is looking for usage of `netcat` or `nc` followed by an IP address, which could be indicative of a reverse shell being established. 

## Why This Matters
If an attacker has managed to inject a reverse shell into your CircleCI pipeline configuration, they could gain unauthorized access to your systems. This could result in data breaches, unauthorized changes, or other damaging actions. 

## How To Fix
This check doesn't necessarily mean that `netcat` shouldn't be used at all, but rather that its usage should be carefully reviewed and justified. If the usage of `netcat` is found and is not justified, it should be removed from the pipeline configuration.

If `netcat` usage is justified and necessary, you should ensure it is being used securely. Avoid hardcoding IP addresses where possible, and never use `netcat` to open a shell that is exposed to the internet or other untrusted networks.

To further secure your CircleCI pipelines, routinely review your configurations and implement secure coding practices. Additionally, limit who has access to modify your pipeline configurations to prevent potential malicious changes.
