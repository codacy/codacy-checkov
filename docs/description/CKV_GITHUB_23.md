## Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_23 - Limit Internal Repository Creation

### Issue

This Checkov security check, identified as "CKV_GITHUB_23", ensures that internal repository creation on GitHub is limited to specific members. The key attribute evaluated by this check is `members_can_create_internal_repositories`.

### Importance from a Security Perspective

Allowing all members to create internal repositories can pose a security risk. It can lead to disorganized, redundant, and potentially insecure data storage. For instance, a member with malicious intent could create a repository with lax security settings, which could be exploited to access sensitive information.

Furthermore, unrestricted creation of internal repositories can lead to difficulty in tracking changes and maintaining compliance with company-wide security policies, as it becomes challenging to monitor all repositories for security vulnerabilities.

### Solution

The solution to this issue is to restrict the ability to create internal repositories to specific, trusted members. This can be achieved by setting the `members_can_create_internal_repositories` attribute to `False`. This means that general members cannot create internal repositories, limiting this ability to only specific, trusted members of the organization.

This restriction not only mitigates security risks associated with unrestricted repository creation but also helps in maintaining an organized, manageable, and secure data storage system.

Here's a sample code snippet that sets the appropriate attribute to `False`:

```python
org = github.get_organization("Your_Organization")
org.edit(members_can_create_internal_repositories=False)
```

Remember to replace `"Your_Organization"` with the actual name of your organization. This code requires the `PyGithub` library. If you haven't installed it already, you can do so using pip:

```bash
pip install PyGithub
```

By following these steps, you ensure that your GitHub organization is secure and manageable, and adheres to best practices for repository creation.
