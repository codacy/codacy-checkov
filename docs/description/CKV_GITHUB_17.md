## Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_17

### Issue Identified
The Checkov security check, identified as `CKV_GITHUB_17`, specifically targets the configuration of push restrictions in GitHub branch protection settings. 

### Why this Matters from a Security Perspective
Push restrictions are a critical security feature in GitHub as they limit who can push to matching branches. By enforcing push restrictions, you can prevent unauthorized or accidental changes to branches, particularly those in production, which could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities or disrupt services.

Without push restrictions, any contributor with write access to the repository can push changes to the branch, which can be risky if not all contributors are equally aware of the security implications of their changes. 

### How to Fix the Issue
To fix this issue, go to the settings of your GitHub repository. Navigate to the 'Branches' tab and then to 'Branch protection rules'. Here, you can add a rule for the branch you want to protect. Under 'Protect matching branches', check the 'Restrict who can push to matching branches' option. Add the teams or individuals who you want to grant push access to. Save the rule to enforce the push restrictions.

This security check will help ensure that your GitHub repositories are configured to follow best practices for branch protection, serving as an important part of your overall security posture. 

In code, this can be done by setting the `restrictions` key in the branch protection settings. This key should include a list of user or team `restrictions` that are allowed to push to the branch.

Remember, an effective security strategy involves both automated checks like this one and a culture of security awareness among all contributors.
