## Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_15

### Issue Identified
This check, identified by the code `CKV_GITHUB_15`, is designed to check for any inactive branches in a GitHub repository that have not been reviewed or removed for a period of 60 days or more.

### Importance from a Security Perspective
Inactive branches can pose a security risk as they might contain outdated code, secrets, or configurations that are no longer relevant to the active state of the project but can be exploited by attackers if left unattended. They might also contain incomplete features or configurations that could expose vulnerabilities if accidentally merged into the active codebase. 

Furthermore, maintaining a clean codebase by removing inactive branches helps to ensure that all the code in your repository is up-to-date and has passed required security checks. This is especially important in a collaborative coding environment where many developers are contributing to the same codebase.

### How to Fix the Issue
The fix for this issue is to review your GitHub repository and remove any branches that have been inactive for 60 days or more. This can be done manually or by implementing a script to automate the process. 

To remove a branch in GitHub manually, you can use the following command:
```
git branch -d [branch_name]
```
Replace `[branch_name]` with the name of the branch you want to delete. If you want to delete the branch regardless of its merge status, you can use the `-D` flag instead of `-d`.

To automate the process, you could set up a script or a GitHub action to periodically check for and delete branches that have been inactive for a specified period of time. This way, you can ensure your codebase remains clean and secure without requiring manual intervention.

The Checkov check `CKV_GITHUB_15` can help you identify these inactive branches by automatically checking your GitHub repository and returning a `FAILED` result if any such branches are found.
