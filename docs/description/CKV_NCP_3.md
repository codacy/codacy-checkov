## Checkov Security Check: CKV_NCP_3

### Security Issue
This Checkov security check, identified as `CKV_NCP_3`, is designed to identify any security group rules that allow outbound traffic to `0.0.0.0/0` or `::/0`. These IP addresses are used to denote all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses respectively, and if outbound traffic is allowed to these addresses, it means the resource is exposed to the entire internet.

### Importance of this Security Check
From a security perspective, allowing outbound traffic to all IP addresses can be a significant risk. This could potentially allow unauthorized and malicious entities to gain access to the resource and extract sensitive data or launch attacks. This is a common misconfiguration that can lead to data breaches or other types of security incidents. It's especially critical in cloud environments, where resources are often publicly accessible by default.

### How to Fix the Issue
To fix this issue, you should review the outbound rules for your security groups and restrict the IP ranges as much as possible. This should be based on the principle of least privilege, which states that a resource should only be accessible to the entities that absolutely need access.

Here's an example of how to define a more restricted outbound rule in a Terraform script:

```hcl
resource "ncloud_access_control_group_rule" "example" {
  access_control_group_no = ncloud_access_control_group.example.no
  outbound = [{
    protocol_type_code = "TCP"
    ip_block = "192.0.2.0/24"
  }]
}
```

In this example, the outbound traffic is only allowed to the IP range `192.0.2.0/24`. This would pass the `CKV_NCP_3` check, as it doesn't allow traffic to `0.0.0.0/0` or `::/0`.
