# Checkov Security Check - CKV_GITLAB_2

## What This Check Does

The security check `CKV_GITLAB_2` is designed to ensure that all GitLab groups require two-factor authentication. The check iterates over the configuration of each group in GitLab. It checks if the `require_two_factor_authentication` property is set to `False` for any group. If such a group is found, the check fails.

## Why This Check is Important

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to the process of data access and rights management. It requires not only a password or a security key but also a piece of information that only the user knows or has access to. This mitigates the risk of potential unauthorized access to sensitive data, even in the event of password compromise.

If two-factor authentication is not enforced across all groups, it opens up a potential security loophole. This is because a group without 2FA requirement can be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, bypassing the extra layer of protection provided by 2FA.

## How to Fix the Issue

To fix the issue, you need to enable two-factor authentication for all GitLab groups. This can be done by setting the `require_two_factor_authentication` property to `True` for each group in your GitLab configuration.

Here is an example of a properly configured group:

```json
{
  "name": "example-group",
  "require_two_factor_authentication": true
}
```

By doing this, you ensure that all members of the group are required to use two-factor authentication, thereby significantly enhancing the security of your GitLab groups.
