# Checkov Security Check: CKV_GHA_5

## Description

The Checkov security check labeled `CKV_GHA_5` is designed to identify a specific security misconfiguration within your GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. GitHub Actions allows you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository. 

The security check `CKV_GHA_5` focuses on the absence of `cosign sign` execution during the artifact build process in your pipeline. Cosign is a container signing and verification tool. If your pipeline builds an artifact but does not have evidence of cosign sign execution, this check fails.

## Security Impact

The lack of `cosign sign` execution during the artifact build process poses a security risk as it allows unsigned and potentially unverified or malicious artifacts to enter your deployment pipeline. 

Signing artifacts provides an additional layer of security and trust to the CI/CD pipeline by ensuring that only verified and trusted artifacts are built and deployed. Without this, an attacker could potentially introduce compromised artifacts into the pipeline, leading to severe consequences such as data breaches, or deployment of vulnerable applications.

## How to Fix

To fix this issue and pass the `CKV_GHA_5` security check, you need to incorporate `cosign sign` execution into your artifact build process within your GitHub Actions pipeline. This involves modifying your GitHub Actions configuration file (usually `main.yml` or `build.yml`) to include a step that executes the `cosign sign` command during the job that builds your artifacts.

Here is a simple example of how to include cosign sign execution in your pipeline:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build artifact
        run: # Insert your build commands here

      - name: Sign artifact with Cosign
        run: cosign sign ${{ secrets.COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY }} my-artifact:version
```

Replace `COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY` with your actual cosign private key secret and `my-artifact:version` with the actual artifact you are building. This will ensure that every artifact build process in your pipeline includes a step for signing the artifact, thus passing the `CKV_GHA_5` security check.
