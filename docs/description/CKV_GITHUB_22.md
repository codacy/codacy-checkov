# Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_22

## What This Check Does

The Checkov security check `CKV_GITHUB_22` is designed to ensure that the capability to create private repositories in GitHub is limited to specific members of an organization. This is done by checking for the attribute `members_can_create_private_repositories` in the GitHub organization settings. 

## Why This Check Matters

From a security perspective, restricting who has the ability to create private repositories is crucial. If unrestricted, any member of the organization can create private repositories, which could potentially contain sensitive information. This could lead to an increased risk of unauthorized access or data leakage if these repositories are not properly managed or protected. 

Furthermore, unrestricted creation of private repositories can lead to a proliferation of repositories that are not tracked or maintained, potentially causing issues with code quality, collaboration, and overall organization.

## How to Fix This Issue

To pass this Checkov security check, you need to ensure that the attribute `members_can_create_private_repositories` is set to `False` in your GitHub organization settings.

Here are the steps to do this:

1. Navigate to your organization's settings page on GitHub.
2. Click on `Member Privileges` on the left sidebar.
3. Under `Repository creation`, look for the `Private` section.
4. Uncheck the box for `Allow members to create private repositories`.
5. Click `Save`.

This will ensure that only organization owners can create private repositories, limiting the potential security risks associated with unrestricted private repository creation.
