## Checkov Security Check: NACLInbound21 (Check ID: CKV_NCP_9)

### Description

The `NACLInbound21` security check in Checkov is designed to identify a specific potential security misconfiguration related to Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) in a cloud environment. This check specifically looks for NACLs that are incorrectly configured to allow inbound traffic on port 21.

### Importance of this Check

Port 21 is typically used for File Transfer Protocol (FTP) services. While FTP can be useful for transferring files between servers, it is not a secure protocol. FTP does not encrypt its traffic, meaning that any data transferred over FTP, including usernames, passwords, and any data files, can potentially be captured by anyone who can monitor the connection.

Insecure configurations that allow unrestricted inbound traffic on port 21 can expose the cloud environment to a range of security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include unauthorized data access, data corruption, and other types of attacks. 

Therefore, this check is important because it helps identify insecure NACL configurations that could potentially allow malicious actors to exploit the FTP services.

### Fixing the Issue

To address this issue, you should first confirm whether your application or system actually requires FTP services. If FTP is not required, the simplest way to fix this issue is to disable inbound traffic on port 21 completely.

If FTP services are required, consider using a secure alternative such as SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or FTPS (FTP Secure), which provide data encryption. Additionally, you should restrict the inbound traffic on port 21 to only trusted sources and ensure that strong authentication measures are in place.

In your NACL configuration, make sure the inbound rules do not allow unrestricted access to port 21. The rules should only allow specific, trusted IP addresses to connect to the FTP services. 

Remember to regularly review and update the NACL rules in line with the principles of least privilege and need-to-know basis to minimize the potential attack surface.
