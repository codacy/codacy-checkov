## Checkov Security Check: CKV_NCP_8

### What this check does:

This check, represented by the class `NACLInbound20`, is a specific configuration check for Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) in a cloud environment, specifically looking at inbound network traffic on port 20.

Port 20 is traditionally used for FTP data transfers and this check identifies whether this port is left open in your NACLs, which could potentially allow unauthorized FTP traffic into your cloud environment.

### Why this is important:

Leaving port 20 open can pose a significant security risk as it might allow unauthorized users to transfer data into your cloud environment, potentially leading to data theft, data corruption, or the introduction of malicious software.

FTP is also an unencrypted protocol, meaning that data transferred using FTP can be intercepted and read by anyone who can access the data in transit. This makes it especially important to ensure that FTP traffic is properly controlled and monitored.

### How to fix this issue:

To rectify this issue, you should review your NACL configurations and ensure that inbound traffic on port 20 is not allowed, unless it is strictly necessary for your use case. If FTP traffic is required, consider using a more secure method of transferring files, such as SFTP or FTPS, which provide encryption for data in transit.

Moreover, it is a good practice to follow the principle of least privilege, i.e., only open those ports that are absolutely necessary for your application to function, and always restrict access to the minimum possible number of IP addresses.

Also, ensure to monitor your network traffic regularly to detect any unusual or unauthorized activities. Use logging and alerting tools to stay informed about your network's security status. 

Remember, an effective security strategy involves both proactive measures (like closing unnecessary ports) and reactive measures (like monitoring and incident response).
