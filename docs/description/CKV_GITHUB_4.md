## Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_4

### Security Issue
The check `CKV_GITHUB_4` from Checkov is designed to identify if GitHub branch protection rules require signed commits. A signed commit is a type of commit that has an additional layer of security that helps prevent unauthorized and malicious modifications to your project. This is done using GPG or S/MIME signature. If this protection rule is not in place, it means that commits can be made without being signed, potentially allowing unauthorized or malicious changes.

### Importance from a Security Perspective
From a security perspective, requiring signed commits is crucial in ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the code in your project. With signed commits, you can verify that changes made to the code are indeed from a trusted source. This reduces the risk of incorporating potentially harmful code into your project. It also helps prevent bad actors from making unauthorized changes, which can lead to security vulnerabilities, data breaches, and other serious issues.

### How to Fix the Issue
To fix this issue, you need to enable the requirement for signed commits in your GitHub repository's branch protection rules. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the main page of your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the `Settings` tab.
3. In the left-side menu, click on `Branches`.
4. Under the `Branch protection rules` section, click on `Add rule` or edit an existing rule.
5. Under `Protect matching branches`, add the branch name pattern you want to protect.
6. Scroll down to find the `Require signed commits` section and check the box next to it.
7. Click on `Create` or `Save changes`.

With this change, the Checkov security check `CKV_GITHUB_4` should pass, indicating that your GitHub branch now requires signed commits, thus increasing the security of your project.
