# Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_13

## What This Check Does

The Checkov security check `CKV_GITHUB_13` ensures that GitHub branch protection requires code owner reviews. This check is looking for the setting `"required_pull_request_reviews/require_code_owner_reviews"` in the GitHub repository's branch protection rules.

## Why This Check Matters

Code owner reviews are a crucial part of ensuring the integrity of code in a repository. A code owner is a person or team that is designated as responsible for a section of code in a repository.

Requiring code owner reviews means that for any code changes in the areas of the repository that they own, those designated owners must review and approve the changes before they can be merged into the protected branch. This can prevent unauthorized or potentially harmful changes from being added to the codebase.

Without this setting, anyone with write access to the repository could potentially merge changes into the protected branch without the code owners' knowledge or approval, which could lead to security vulnerabilities or other issues.

## How to Fix The Issue

To fix this issue, you need to enable the setting for requiring code owner reviews in your GitHub repository's branch protection rules. 

This can be done in the repository's settings:

1. Go to the main page of the repository.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click "Branches".
4. Under "Branch protection rules", click "Add rule" or edit an existing rule.
5. Under "Protect matching branches", set the branch name pattern you want to apply the rule to.
6. Under "Rules", in the "Pull request reviews" section, check the box for "Require review from Code Owners".
7. Click "Create" or "Save changes".

After doing this, the Checkov security check `CKV_GITHUB_13` should pass, indicating that your repository's branch protection rules now require code owner reviews.
