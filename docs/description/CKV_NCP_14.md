# Checkov Security Check: CKV_NCP_14 - Ensure NAS is Securely Encrypted

## Issue Identified by this Check

This Checkov security check, identified as `CKV_NCP_14`, verifies if network attached storage (NAS) volumes are encrypted. Specifically, it checks the `ncloud_nas_volume` resource for the `is_encrypted_volume` key to determine if encryption is enabled. 

## Why this Issue Matters

Encryption is a critical security measure that helps to protect data at rest. In the case of a NAS volume, encryption ensures that the data stored is unreadable without the appropriate decryption key. Therefore, if an unauthorized individual or process were to gain access to the NAS volume, they would still not be able to read the data without the decryption key. 

Failure to encrypt sensitive data can lead to data breaches, which not only impact the privacy of users but can also lead to significant financial and reputational damage. It's particularly important in industries where strict data protection regulations apply, such as healthcare or finance, as failure to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines.

## How to Fix this Issue

To resolve this issue, you should enable encryption for the `ncloud_nas_volume` resource in your Terraform configuration. This can be done by setting the `is_encrypted_volume` key to `true`. For example:

```hcl
resource "ncloud_nas_volume" "example" {
  ...
  is_encrypted_volume = true
  ...
}
```

This configuration ensures that the NAS volume is encrypted, thus making the data unreadable without the appropriate decryption key.

In addition to enabling encryption, you should also properly manage the encryption keys. It's recommended to use a secure key management system to automatically handle the creation, storage, and rotation of encryption keys.
