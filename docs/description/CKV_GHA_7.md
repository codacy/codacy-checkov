# Checkov Security Check - CKV_GHA_7: EmptyWorkflowDispatch

## Security Issue Identified

The `EmptyWorkflowDispatch` security check identifies GitHub Actions workflows that have non-empty `workflow_dispatch` inputs. 

In GitHub Actions, `workflow_dispatch` is an event that triggers workflows manually, and it can accept user-defined inputs. If these inputs are non-empty, it means the build output can be manipulated by user parameters other than the build entry point and the top-level source location. This is a potential security risk as it opens up opportunities for unauthorized changes and potential injection attacks.

## Security Perspective

From a security perspective, this issue matters because it could allow malicious actors to influence the build process in ways that could lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, an attacker could potentially pass harmful code or commands as input parameters, leading to code injection or command injection attacks.

Moreover, allowing user parameters to affect the build output could lead to unpredictable results and inconsistencies, which could undermine the reliability and integrity of the application.

## Fixing the Issue

To fix the issue, ensure that the `workflow_dispatch` inputs in your GitHub Actions workflows are empty. This means that the build output should only be affected by the build entry point and the top-level source location, and not by any user-defined parameters.

You can do this by removing any input parameters from the `workflow_dispatch` event in your GitHub Actions workflow files. If you need to accept input parameters for your workflows, consider using other mechanisms that do not affect the build output or pose security risks.

In the end, the `workflow_dispatch` declaration in your GitHub Actions workflow files should look like this:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch: {}
```
This ensures that no user inputs can affect the build output, mitigating the identified security risk.
