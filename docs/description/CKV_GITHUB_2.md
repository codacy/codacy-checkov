# Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_21

## Issue

The Checkov security check `CKV_GITHUB_21` specifically identifies the security issue of unrestricted public repository creation on GitHub. The check searches for the `members_can_create_public_repositories` attribute in your GitHub organization settings and verifies if its value is set to `False`.

## Security perspective

From a security perspective, this configuration is crucial. If the attribute `members_can_create_public_repositories` is set to `True`, it means that any member of your GitHub organization can create public repositories. Public repositories are visible to everyone on the internet and could potentially expose sensitive information if a member mistakenly pushes such information into the public repository.

In addition, allowing all members to create public repositories can lead to unnecessary exposure of your organization's codebase, potentially opening up opportunities for malicious actors to study your code for vulnerabilities or to make unwanted copies of your code.

## Solution

To fix this issue, you should restrict public repository creation to specific members or teams within your organization. You can do this by setting the `members_can_create_public_repositories` attribute to `False` in your GitHub organization settings. This means that only organization owners will be able to create public repositories by default.

In case you need to allow specific members or teams to create public repositories, you can grant them the necessary permissions separately. This ensures that public repository creation is a controlled action, reducing the risk of unintentional exposure of sensitive information.
