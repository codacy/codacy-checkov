# Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_16

## Description
This Checkov security check, labelled as "CKV_GITHUB_16", is designed to ensure that GitHub branch protection requires conversation resolution. 

## Security Issue
The specific security issue this check identifies is the absence of a required conversation resolution in the GitHub branch protection settings. Conversation resolution in this context means that before merging pull requests, all comments and discussions must be resolved. This ensures that all code changes are properly reviewed and all potential issues are addressed before they are merged into the main codebase.

When conversation resolution is not enforced, there is a risk that important feedback, potential bugs, or security vulnerabilities discussed in the comments may not be addressed before code is merged. This could lead to the introduction of vulnerabilities into the codebase, which could be exploited by malicious actors.

## Importance from a Security Perspective
From a security perspective, requiring conversation resolution is very important. It ensures that all comments and discussions related to a pull request are resolved before merging. This includes feedback on potential security issues. Without this requirement, there is a risk that unresolved conversations containing important security feedback might be overlooked, leading to potential vulnerabilities in the final codebase.

## How to Fix the Issue
To fix the issue, you need to enable the requirement for conversation resolution in the branch protection settings of your GitHub repository. 

Here are the steps to do this:

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click "Branches".
4. Under the "Branch protection rules" section, click "Add rule" or edit an existing rule.
5. Under the "Protect matching branches" section, tick the checkbox that says "Require conversation resolution before merging".
6. Finally, click "Create" or "Save changes".

By following these steps, you will ensure that all conversations must be resolved before code changes can be merged, thereby enforcing better code review practices and reducing the chance of introducing security vulnerabilities into your codebase.
