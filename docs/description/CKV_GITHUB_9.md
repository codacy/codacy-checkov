## Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_9

### Security Issue/Misconfiguration
The security check `CKV_GITHUB_9` identifies GitHub repositories that do not have at least two administrators. 

### Why This Issue Matters
Having at least two administrators for a repository is crucial for maintaining continuity of operations and mitigating risks. If there is only one administrator and they are unavailable or leave the organization, changes to the repository's settings, permissions, or other administrative tasks may be delayed or impossible, potentially causing disruption to the project or even security risks. Additionally, having a secondary administrator provides a layer of oversight, reducing the chance of unauthorized or malicious changes.

### How to Fix the Issue
To remediate this issue, ensure that at least two users have administrative permissions for each GitHub repository. To do this, navigate to the settings of the repository, go to the 'Manage Access' section, and add another administrator. Be sure to select the 'Admin' role when adding the user to grant them full administrative permissions.

### Code Explanation
The `GithubRepositoryCollaborators` class is a Checkov security check that verifies if the number of administrators for a repository is at least two. It scans the configuration of an entity (in this case, a GitHub repository) and counts the number of administrators by iterating over the `repository_collaborators` and checking if the 'admin' permission is set to true. If the count of 'admin' collaborators is less than two, the check fails.
