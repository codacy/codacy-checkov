# Ensure no NACL allow inbound from 0.0.0.0:0 to port 3389

# Explanation

This security check relates to Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) in AWS, specifically looking for inbound traffic on port 3389. 

## Security Issue

The code specifies a Checkov security check (CKV_NCP_11) that identifies if there is an inbound rule allowing traffic through port 3389 in your NACLs. Port 3389 is commonly used for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections, which allow remote access to servers and workstations.

## Importance from Security Perspective

From a security perspective, allowing unrestricted inbound access on port 3389 can be a significant risk. If your NACLs permit inbound traffic on this port, it could potentially enable unauthorized users to initiate RDP sessions, gain remote access to your systems, and execute malicious actions. This could lead to data breaches, system disruptions, and other severe security incidents.

## How to Fix the Issue

To mitigate this risk, you should restrict inbound traffic on port 3389 to only trusted IP addresses. This can be done by modifying the inbound rules of your NACLs to either deny all traffic on port 3389 altogether or limit it to specific, trusted IP ranges.

Additionally, consider using secure methods for remote access, like Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), or leveraging AWS services like Systems Manager Session Manager, which allows secure and auditable remote access without the need to open inbound ports.

Remember to apply the principle of least privilege, only granting access where absolutely necessary and regularly reviewing and updating your security controls.
