# Checkov Security Check: CKV_NCP_19

## Summary
This Checkov security check, identified as `CKV_NCP_19`, is designed to ensure that the public endpoint of a Naver Kubernetes Service (NKS) cluster is disabled. 

## Security Issue
The misconfiguration that this check identifies is when the `public_network` attribute of a NKS cluster is set to `True`. This means that the cluster is accessible publicly, which is a significant security risk. 

Kubernetes is a popular, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. If the public endpoint of a Kubernetes cluster is enabled, it becomes accessible over the internet. This increases the attack surface for potential malicious actors, who could exploit vulnerabilities in the Kubernetes system, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or even takeovers of the system.

## Importance
From a security perspective, it's essential to minimize the attack surface by restricting public access to sensitive systems, such as Kubernetes clusters. By ensuring that the public endpoint is disabled, we can prevent unauthorized access to the cluster and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data and services within the cluster.

## Solution
To fix the issue, set the `public_network` attribute to `False` in the configuration of the NKS cluster. This will disable the public endpoint of the cluster, making it inaccessible over the internet. 

Here is an example of how to configure the attribute correctly:

```hcl
resource "ncloud_nks_cluster" "example" {
  cluster_name   = "example-cluster"
  ...
  public_network = false
  ...
}
```
Remember to always verify your changes and rerun the Checkov security check to ensure the misconfiguration has been addressed. Keep in mind that disabling public network access also means you'll need to set up appropriate private access mechanisms for authorized users to interact with the cluster.
