## Checkov Security Check: CKV_LIN_3 - EmailExists

### Issue Identified

This Checkov security check, identified as `CKV_LIN_3`, is designed to validate that an email address is set for a `linode_user` resource. 

### Security Importance

From a security perspective, it is crucial to have a valid email address associated with each user. This is because the email address often serves as a unique identifier for the user and is frequently used for communications, notifications, and password resets. Without a valid email address, user management, accountability, and recovery mechanisms may be negatively impacted. 

If an audit trail is required, having an email associated with each action can help investigators track actions back to the individual user. Moreover, in the event of an account compromise, the email serves as a recovery mechanism, allowing users to reclaim their account.

### Recommended Fix

To remediate this issue, ensure that you have an email address specified for every `linode_user` resource. The email address can be set using the `email` attribute in the resource block. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```terraform
resource "linode_user" "example" {
  username = "example_user"
  email    = "example_user@example.com"
}
```

In this example, the `linode_user` named `example_user` is associated with the email address "example_user@example.com". Please replace this with the actual username and email address.

After making these changes, rerun the Checkov scan to verify that the `CKV_LIN_3` security check passes.
