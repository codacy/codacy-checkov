# CKV_NCP_4: Check for Open SSH (Port 22) In Inbound Rules of Access Control Groups

## Issue: Open SSH on Inbound Rules of Access Control Groups
This check identifies a potential security issue where SSH (Secure Shell), running on port 22, is open in the inbound rules of an access control group.

SSH is a protocol that provides a secure channel over an unsecured network. It is commonly used for remote server login and command execution. However, having an open SSH in the inbound rules exposes the system to potential unauthorized access and brute force attacks.

## Security Impact
From a security perspective, an open SSH on port 22 in the inbound rules is a significant risk. It allows any IP address to attempt to connect to your system via SSH. This can potentially lead to unauthorized access if the attacker can guess or otherwise obtain the login credentials. Furthermore, it exposes your system to brute-force attacks, where an attacker systematically checks all possible passwords until the correct one is found.

## Recommended Fix
To fix this issue, you should limit the source IP addresses that can connect to your system via SSH. This can be done by specifying the allowed source IP addresses in the inbound rule for port 22. Ideally, only trusted IP addresses that require SSH access should be allowed. 

In addition, consider using key-based authentication instead of password authentication for SSH, as it is more secure. Key-based authentication uses a pair of public-private keys which are more difficult to crack than a password.

It's also recommended to implement an intrusion detection or prevention system (IDS/IPS) to detect and potentially block brute force attacks. 

## Sample Code Fix
```python
# your code here to fix the issue
