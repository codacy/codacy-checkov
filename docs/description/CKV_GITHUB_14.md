# Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_14 - Require Status Checks

## What this check identifies
This Checkov security check, identified as `CKV_GITHUB_14`, is designed to ensure that all GitHub branches require status checks to have passed before new code can be merged. Specifically, this check is looking for the configuration key `required_status_checks`.

## Why this issue matters
From a security perspective, this check is important because it helps enforce a key best practice in maintaining code integrity and preventing the introduction of potential vulnerabilities. 

Status checks might include various forms of automated testing, such as unit tests, integration tests, and static code analysis. These tests are designed to catch common coding mistakes, potential security vulnerabilities, and ensure the new code does not break existing functionality. 

If status checks are not required before merging new code, there is a higher risk that untested or inadequately reviewed code could introduce bugs, vulnerabilities, or other issues into the codebase. This could potentially lead to security breaches, data leaks, system crashes, or other adverse events.

## How to fix the issue
To fix this issue, you need to configure your GitHub repository to require status checks before code can be merged. This can be done in the repository settings under the "Branches" and then "Branch protection rules" section. Here, you can add a new rule or edit an existing rule to require status checks.

In the "Protect matching branches" section, enter the branch name pattern you want the rule to apply to. Then, in the "Protect your branch" section, check the box for "Require status checks to pass before merging". You can then specify which status checks must pass for the rule to be satisfied.

By implementing this fix, you can ensure that the code merged into your protected branches is thoroughly tested and less likely to introduce security vulnerabilities or other issues.
