# Checkov Security Check: CKV_YC_11

## What does this check do?

The `CKV_YC_11` check, named "Ensure security group is assigned to network interface", verifies that a security group is correctly assigned to the network interface of a Yandex Compute instance. 

The specific key that this check inspects in the Terraform configuration is `network_interface/[0]/security_group_ids`. 

## Why is this important?

A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your virtual machine to control inbound and outbound traffic. When you launch an instance in a VPC, you can assign the instance to up to five security groups. Therefore, assigning a security group to a network interface is a fundamental step to protect your cloud environment. 

Not assigning a security group to a network interface could lead to unprotected network traffic, which could be exploited by malicious actors to compromise your system. 

## How to fix this issue?

To fix this issue, you should assign a security group to your network interface in your Terraform configuration code. This can be done by adding a `security_group_ids` attribute to your `network_interface` block, specifying the appropriate security group. 

Here is an example:

```hcl
resource "yandex_compute_instance" "example" {
  name = "example"

  network_interface {
    network_id = "<network-id>"
    security_group_ids = ["<security-group-id>"]
  }
}
```

In this example, replace `<network-id>` with the ID of your VPC network and `<security-group-id>` with the ID of your security group. 

This will ensure that your network interface is protected by the specified security group, fulfilling the `CKV_YC_11` check and enhancing the security of your cloud environment.
