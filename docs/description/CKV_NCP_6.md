# Checkov Security Check: ServerEncryptionVPC (CKV_NCP_6)

## Security Issue/Misconfiguration

This Checkov security check, identified as "CKV_NCP_6", validates if a server instance is correctly encrypted. Specifically, it checks the `is_encrypted_base_block_storage_volume` value in the configuration of the `ncloud_server` resource in Terraform scripts. 

The `is_encrypted_base_block_storage_volume` value indicates whether the base block storage volume of an `ncloud_server` instance is encrypted. If this value is not set to true or is missing, it implies that the server instance may not be using encryption for its base block storage volume, which could expose sensitive data.

## Importance From a Security Perspective

Encryption is a fundamental security control that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data. When data is encrypted, it is transformed into an unreadable format, which can only be reverted or read by entities possessing the correct decryption key. 

In the context of a server instance, encrypting the base block storage volume is crucial because it could be storing sensitive information such as user data, application data, or system configurations. If this volume is not encrypted, unauthorized individuals or systems could potentially gain access to this sensitive information, leading to data breaches, violation of user privacy, or even system compromise.

## How to Fix the Issue

To rectify this misconfiguration, you should ensure that your `ncloud_server` instances have the `is_encrypted_base_block_storage_volume` attribute set to `true`. This will enable encryption for the base block storage volume, protecting the data stored in it. 

Here is an example of how to correctly configure this attribute:

```hcl
resource "ncloud_server" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  is_encrypted_base_block_storage_volume = true
}
```

Remember to review your Terraform scripts regularly to ensure that encryption is enabled for all existing and new server instances. Consider automating this process using tools like Checkov to maintain consistent security practices across your infrastructure.
