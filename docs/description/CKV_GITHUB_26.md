# Checkov Security Check: Ensure Minimum Admins in Organization (CKV_GITHUB_26)

## What This Check Does

This Checkov security check, `GithubMinimumAdminsInOrganization`, validates that the number of administrators (admins) in a GitHub organization does not exceed a defined maximum limit (3 in this case).

## Why This Check Matters

Admins in a GitHub organization have extensive privileges, including the ability to manage team memberships, repositories, organization accounts, and more. If there are too many admins, it increases the risk of accidental or malicious activities. For instance, an admin might inadvertently delete critical repositories, or in a worst-case scenario, a compromised admin account could lead to severe data breaches or disruptions.

Therefore, limiting the number of admins can reduce the potential attack surface and lower the risk of human error. It enforces the principle of least privilege, an important security concept that dictates that a user should have the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their job functions.

## How to Fix This Issue

If this check fails, it means there are more than the defined maximum number of admins in the GitHub organization. To fix this issue, review the list of admins in your organization and determine if they all require admin level privileges. 

If some admins do not need such extensive permissions, you should downgrade their access level. This can be done through the GitHub organization settings:

1. Navigate to your organization under "Your Organizations" on the GitHub home page.
2. Click on "People" in the organization settings.
3. Identify the people who do not need admin privileges. Click on the "Role" dropdown next to their name and change it to "Member" or the appropriate level.

Remember that this process should be done carefully, ensuring necessary permissions for the organization's functioning are not inadvertently removed.
