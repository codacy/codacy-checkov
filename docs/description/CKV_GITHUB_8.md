# Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_8
## Description
This Checkov security check, identified as `CKV_GITHUB_8`, looks specifically at your GitHub branch protection rules to ensure that it requires a linear history. This means that it checks if your GitHub repository settings enforce a linear commit history on protected branches, preventing commit history from becoming cluttered with unnecessary merge commits.

## Why this matters
From a security perspective, maintaining a linear history is important for a few reasons:

1. **Auditability**: A linear history makes it easier to understand the chronology of commits, which can be beneficial during audits or incident investigations. 

2. **Simplicity**: It simplifies the commit history, making it easier to track changes, identify when and where changes were introduced, and who introduced them. This can be helpful in identifying potential security issues or vulnerabilities introduced in the code.

3. **Accountability**: It ensures that every commit has only one parent, which increases accountability as each commit is associated with a specific author.

It is important to note that while this check does not directly relate to a typical security vulnerability (like SQL injection or Cross Site Scripting), it is a good practice from a secure software development and operations (DevSecOps) perspective.

## How to fix the issue
If this check fails, it means your GitHub repository is not set to require a linear history. You can fix this by changing your branch protection rules.

Follow these steps to enforce a linear commit history:

1. Navigate to the main page of your GitHub repository.
2. Click on `Settings` tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click `Branches`.
4. Under `Branch protection rules`, click `Add rule` or edit an existing rule.
5. You'll find a checkbox labeled `Require linear history`. Check this box.
6. Click on `Create` or `Save changes`.

Now, your GitHub repository requires a linear commit history, and this Checkov check should pass.
