## Checkov Security Check: CKV_YC_23

### Issue Identified

This Checkov security check, identified by the code `CKV_YC_23`, is designed to identify and prevent misconfigurations in Yandex Cloud's Identity and Access Management (IAM) settings that could grant elevated access to folder members. Specifically, it checks for roles assigned to folder members that provide `admin` or `editor` privileges.

### Importance from a Security Perspective

From a security perspective, this issue is of high importance. Providing elevated access roles, such as `admin` or `editor`, can potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources, as well as enabling unintended or malicious changes to the system. This can violate the principle of least privilege, a key security best practice that recommends only granting the minimum necessary access rights to each user or service.

### Solution

To fix this issue, follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles to IAM members. Instead of granting `admin` or `editor` roles to folder members, assign less privileged roles that only provide the permissions necessary for the user or service to perform their intended functions.

Modify your IAM configurations to assign less privileged roles to your users or services. After making these changes, run the `CKV_YC_23` check again to ensure that the issue has been resolved. If the check passes, your updated configurations follow best practices for limiting access rights.
