## Checkov Security Check: CKV_NCP_16

### What This Check Does

The security check CKV_NCP_16, named "Ensure Load Balancer isn't exposed to the internet", scans your configuration to identify if your network load balancer is unnecessarily exposed to the internet. This check specifically targets the `ncloud_lb` resource. 

The main aspect this check inspects is the `network_type` of the load balancer. It expects the `network_type` to be set to `PRIVATE`.

### Why This Check Matters

From a security perspective, this check is critical as it helps to ensure that your load balancer is not exposed to unnecessary risks. 

If a load balancer is set to a public network type, it can be accessed directly from the internet. This can expose your system to a variety of threats including DDoS attacks, data breaches, or unauthorized access. By ensuring that your load balancer is private, you are adding an additional layer of security and reducing its exposure to potential threats.

### How to Fix the Issue

To fix this issue and pass the CKV_NCP_16 security check, you should ensure that your `ncloud_lb` resource is configured with the `network_type` set to `PRIVATE`.

Here is a sample of what a correct configuration might look like:

```hcl
resource "ncloud_lb" "example" {
  network_type = "PRIVATE"
  # ... other configuration ...
}
```

Remember, always consider the security implications of your configuration choices. In this case, unless there is a specific need for the load balancer to be public, it is safer to keep it private.
