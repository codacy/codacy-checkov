# Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_3

## What this check does

This particular Checkov security check, identified by the code "CKV_GITHUB_3", looks at the security settings of a GitHub organization to ensure that the "IP allow list" feature is enabled.

The IP allow list is a security feature that restricts access to the GitHub organization's resources to a designated list of IP addresses.

Specifically, this check looks at the `ipAllowListForInstalledAppsEnabledSetting` attribute, which governs whether the IP allow list is enabled for installed apps within the GitHub organization.

## Why this check matters

The IP allow list feature is critical for safeguarding an organization's GitHub resources. By limiting access to specific IP addresses, an organization can effectively prevent unauthorized users from accessing its GitHub resources, even if they manage to obtain the organization's login credentials.

This is particularly important for installed apps, which often have extensive permissions and access to sensitive data and resources within the organization's GitHub account.

Without the IP allow list feature enabled, malicious actors could potentially exploit these apps to access, steal, or manipulate the organization's code and data.

## How to fix the issue

To resolve this issue, you need to enable the IP allow list for installed apps in your GitHub organization's settings:

1. Go to your GitHub organization's settings page.
2. Click on the "Security" tab.
3. Look for the "IP allow list" section.
4. Check the box for "Enable IP allow list for installed GitHub Apps".
5. Click on "Save" to apply the changes.

Remember to add the IP addresses of all devices that should have access to the installed apps. Be cautious and make sure not to add any IP addresses that you do not trust.
