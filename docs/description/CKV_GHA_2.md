## Checkov Security Check: CKV_GHA_2

### Security Issue

The `DontAllowShellInjection` check identifies a common security vulnerability known as shell injection. This occurs when a program allows users to directly execute shell commands, potentially enabling attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the system. 

In this specific check, the code scans run commands in GitHub Actions workflows for potential shell injection vulnerabilities. It checks if any of the run commands contain specific terms that are commonly associated with shell injection attacks.

### Importance from a Security Perspective

Shell injection vulnerabilities are a serious security issue. They potentially allow an attacker to execute any command they wish on the system running the vulnerable software. This could lead to a variety of damaging outcomes, from data theft to denial of service to complete system takeover.

In the context of GitHub Actions, a shell injection vulnerability could enable an attacker to run harmful commands on the GitHub-hosted runner performing the workflow, possibly leading to unauthorized access to the repository or other sensitive data.

### How to Fix the Issue

To fix a shell injection vulnerability, you should avoid including direct shell commands in your GitHub Actions workflows whenever possible. Instead, use GitHub Actions built-in commands or actions that accomplish the same tasks.

If you must include a shell command, never include untrusted input in the command. If the command requires user input, sanitize the input to remove or escape potentially dangerous characters.

Also, regularly use tools like Checkov to scan your code for potential shell injection vulnerabilities. This helps ensure that you catch and fix these issues before they become a problem.
