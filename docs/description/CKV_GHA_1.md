# Ensure ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS isn't true on environment variables

This Checkov security check, referred to as `ExampleCheckTrueFalse` in the source code, identifies a specific misconfiguration in GitHub Actions environment variables. It checks if the `ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS` is set to `true` in the job configuration.

## Security Issue:
The `ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS` is an environment variable in GitHub Actions that, when set to `true`, allows the execution of potentially unsecure commands. This might expose a system to attacks such as command injection, where an attacker could execute malicious commands in the system. 

## Security Importance:
From a security perspective, this issue is significant because it could lead to unauthorized access, data exposure, or even complete system compromise. It is therefore critical to ensure that this environment variable is not set to `true`, preventing the execution of unsecure commands. 

## Fixing the Issue:
To fix this issue, you should set the `ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS` environment variable to `false` in your job configuration. This will prevent the execution of unsecure commands, thus enhancing the security of your system.

Here's an example of a secure job configuration:

```yaml
jobs:
  secure-job:
    name: job3
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS: false
    steps:
      - name: secure-step
        run: |
          echo "ok"
```
In this configuration, `ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS` is set to `false`, meaning that unsecure commands will not be permitted to run, mitigating the risk of command injection attacks.
