# Checkov Security Check: `GithubRequire2Approvals`

## Security Issue

The `GithubRequire2Approvals` check identifies if there is a misconfiguration in the GitHub branch protection settings which allows changes to be made to the code base without the approval of at least two strongly authenticated users. 

The attribute this check focuses on is `required_pull_request_reviews/required_approving_review_count`. This attribute defines how many approvals are required for a pull request to be merged.

## Security Implication

From a security perspective, this is crucial as it ensures that no single individual can make changes to the code base without review. This is a safeguard against both accidental and malicious changes. 

Without this setting in place, a single user could potentially introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors into the system either knowingly or unknowingly. This also ensures that a more thorough review process is in place, which could catch potential bugs or issues that a single reviewer might miss. 

## Resolution

To address and resolve this issue, you need to configure your GitHub branch protection settings to require at least two approving reviews before a pull request can be merged. 

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click 'Settings'.
3. In the left menu, click 'Branches'.
4. Next to 'Branch protection rules', click 'Add rule'.
5. Under 'Protect matching branches', specify the branch pattern for the branches you want to protect.
6. Under 'Rule settings', check 'Require pull request reviews before merging'.
7. In the 'Required approving reviews' drop-down menu, select '2' or more.
8. Click 'Create' or 'Save changes'.

This will ensure that your code base is better protected from error and malicious modifications.
