# Ensure Load Balancer Listener Using HTTPS

## Checkov Security Check: CKV_NCP_24

### What This Check Does

CKV_NCP_24 is a Checkov security check that ensures Load Balancer Listener is using HTTPS. More specifically, this check is intended for resources of the type `ncloud_lb_listener`.

It does this by inspecting the `protocol` key of the resource configuration. If the value of this key is not 'HTTPS', the check fails.

### Why This Check Matters

Using HTTPS for load balancer listeners is an important security best practice. HTTPS, or HTTP Secure, is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. 

The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted. This is important because it prevents 'man-in-the-middle' attacks, where attackers may attempt to intercept and modify the data being sent between the client and the server.

In the context of a load balancer, not using HTTPS could mean that any data being sent to or from your website could potentially be intercepted and modified by attackers. This can lead to a variety of security issues, including data theft, session hijacking, and more.

### How To Fix This Issue

To fix this issue, you should update the configuration of your `ncloud_lb_listener` resources to use HTTPS. You can do this by setting the `protocol` key to 'HTTPS'. 

Here is an example of a corrected configuration:

```hcl
resource "ncloud_lb_listener" "listener" {
  protocol        = "HTTPS"
  ...
}
```

After making this change, re-run the Checkov security check to confirm that the issue has been resolved.
