# Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_10

## What This Check Does

Checkov security check `CKV_GITHUB_10`, named "Ensure branch protection rules are enforced on administrators", is designed to identify misconfigurations in your GitHub repository settings where branch protection rules are not enforced on users with administrative privileges.

In particular, it checks if the `enforce_admins/enabled` setting is enabled in your GitHub repository. This setting ensures that even administrators of the repository are required to abide by the branch protection rules.

## Why This Issue Matters

Enforcing branch protection rules on administrators is a crucial aspect of maintaining the security and integrity of your codebase. 

Without this setting, administrators can bypass the rules set to protect the codebase, such as requiring pull request reviews before merging, requiring status checks to pass before merging, and more. This could lead to potential security risks like the introduction of vulnerabilities in the code, accidental deletion of branches, or unauthorized changes.

Even well-intended administrators can make mistakes. Enforcing branch protection rules on all users, including administrators, helps prevent these potential issues and contributes to maintaining a secure and stable codebase.

## How to Fix This Issue

To fix this issue, you need to enable the `enforce_admins/enabled` setting in your GitHub repository. 

Here are the steps to do this:

1. Navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Branches".
4. Under "Branch protection rules", click "Add rule" or edit an existing rule.
5. Check the box labeled "Include administrators" under "Enforce rules for administrators".
6. Click on "Create" or "Save changes".

By doing this, you ensure that all branch protection rules are also applied to administrators, enhancing the security of your repository.
