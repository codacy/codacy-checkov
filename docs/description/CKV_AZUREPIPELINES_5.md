## Checkov Security Checks: CKV_AZUREPIPELINES_5 - Detecting Image Usages

### Issue:
This security check, known as "CKV_AZUREPIPELINES_5", looks for the usage of images in Azure Pipelines workflows. Specifically, it scans the configuration of `jobs[]`, `stages[].jobs[]`, and `*.container[]` entities for any image usage.

Images in this context refer to Docker images that are used to define the environment for executing tasks in a job. Misconfigurations can occur when images from untrusted or insecure sources are used in the workflow.

### Why it matters: 
From a security perspective, using images from untrusted sources can lead to severe issues. These images could contain malicious code or outdated software with known vulnerabilities. This can compromise the security of the entire software supply chain. It could lead to the unauthorized access, data breaches, or the execution of arbitrary code in your cloud environment.

### How to Fix:
To mitigate this risk, ensure that you are only using images from trusted and secure sources in your Azure Pipelines workflows. Preferably, use official images from Docker Hub or images from your organization's private registry.

In addition, perform regular vulnerability scanning on the images you use and update them regularly to patch any known security flaws. Consider enforcing policies that only allow images to be downloaded from trusted registries.

Finally, it's also recommended to enable automatic updates for images to ensure they are always using the most secure and updated version.

Please note that this Checkov check is currently in a 'passing' state by default. You may want to extend this check to include specific image usage policies according to your organization's needs.
