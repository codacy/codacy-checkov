# Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_20

## What Does This Check Do?

The CKV_GITHUB_20 security check in Checkov identifies if there is a potential misconfiguration in your GitHub repository where open git branches can be merged into the main codebase, even if they are not up to date with the latest commit.

Specifically, this check evaluates the `required_status_checks/strict` attribute in your GitHub repository settings. If this attribute is set to `False`, the check will fail.

## Why Is This Important?

Keeping git branches up to date before merging them into the main codebase is crucial for maintaining the stability and integrity of your project. If branches are not kept up to date, there is a greater risk of merge conflicts, which can be time-consuming to resolve and can introduce errors or vulnerabilities into the codebase if not handled properly. 

Furthermore, if a branch is not up to date, it may miss critical security updates or bug fixes that have been implemented in the main codebase, which can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities or reintroduce bugs that have already been fixed.

## How To Fix The Issue

To correct this issue and pass the CKV_GITHUB_20 check, you should ensure that the `required_status_checks/strict` attribute in your GitHub repository settings is set to `True`. 

This will enforce that all open branches must be up to date with the latest commit in the main codebase before they can be merged. This can be achieved by either manually updating the branch or by using the 'Update branch' button on GitHub before merging.

Remember, maintaining up-to-date branches is a best practice for ensuring the stability and security of your codebase.
