## Checkov Security Check: ComputeVMSerialConsole (CKV_YC_4)

### What does this check do?

This Checkov security check, `ComputeVMSerialConsole`, identifies a particular misconfiguration where a compute instance might have its serial console enabled. The specific resource the check supports is `yandex_compute_instance`.

In the context of the source code, the check looks for the key `metadata/[0]/serial-port-enable`. If this key is set to `True`, it signifies that the serial console is enabled, and the check will return a failed status.

### Why is this check important?

From a security perspective, enabling the serial console on a compute instance can present a significant risk. The serial console provides a way to interact with your instances and troubleshoot malfunctioning instances. If an unauthorized user gains access to this console, they can potentially control the entire system. 

This can lead to several security issues, including unauthorized data access, data manipulation, and further exploitation of the system. Thus, it is highly recommended to disable the serial console unless it's strictly necessary for your use case.

### How to fix the issue?

If the Checkov security check fails, it means that the serial console is enabled for a compute instance. To fix this issue and improve the security of your system, you need to disable the serial console. 

In the configuration file of your `yandex_compute_instance`, find the line with `metadata/[0]/serial-port-enable` and set its value to `False`. This will disable the serial console, mitigating the potential risks associated with it. Remember to review and apply this setting for all relevant compute instances in your environment.
