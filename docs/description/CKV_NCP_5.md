# Checkov Security Check: CKV_NCP_5

## Security Issue
The Checkov security check `CKV_NCP_5` identifies if an Access Control Group (ACG) in Naver Cloud Platform (NCP) has inbound rules that allow unrestricted access to port 3389. Port 3389 is generally used for Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service.

## Security Implication
Unrestricted access to port 3389 can pose a significant security risk. If an attacker is able to connect to this port, they may gain unauthorized remote access to the system, potentially leading to data breaches, system damage, or other malicious activities. NCP instances that have this port open to the internet are especially at risk.

## Resolution
To fix this issue, review the inbound rules for the Access Control Group in question. If possible, restrict access to port 3389 by specifying allowed IP addresses or IP ranges. If your application does not require the use of Microsoft's RDP service, consider closing port 3389 entirely.

In general, it's a good practice to limit access to any service ports, only allowing trusted IP addresses or IP ranges. This reduces the potential attack surface and helps protect your systems against unauthorized access.
