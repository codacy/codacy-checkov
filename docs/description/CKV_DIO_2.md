# Checkov Security Check: DropletSSHKeys (CKV_DIO_2)

## Security Issue Addressed

This security check, `DropletSSHKeys`, ensures that an SSH key is specified for the DigitalOcean droplet. The droplet is a self-contained platform providing the necessary infrastructure to run and manage applications and services. The `ssh_keys` attribute in the droplet configuration should have a value assigned to it.

SSH (Secure Shell) keys are an access credential used in the SSH protocol, which is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another. They provide a much more secure way of logging into a virtual private server with SSH than using a password alone.

## Why This Issue Matters

Not specifying an SSH key in a droplet's configuration can lead to potential security risks. An SSH key is a secure method of authentication that provides an alternative to password-based logins. Without specifying an SSH key, a droplet might default to less secure methods of authentication, making it potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access.

SSH keys are more secure than passwords and can help protect against brute force login attempts by attackers. They also provide a way to ensure that only authorized individuals can access the droplet, further reducing the potential of a security breach.

## How to Fix the Issue

To resolve this issue, you need to specify an SSH key in the `ssh_keys` attribute of the `digitalocean_droplet` resource configuration. If you have already generated an SSH key, you can add its fingerprint to the `ssh_keys` attribute as follows:

```hcl
resource "digitalocean_droplet" "web" {
  name       = "web-1"
  size       = "s-1vcpu-1gb"
  image      = "ubuntu-18-04-x64"
  region     = "nyc1"
  ssh_keys   = ["YOUR_SSH_KEY_FINGERPRINT"]
  # ...
}
```

If you haven't generated an SSH key yet, you can do so by following DigitalOcean's guide on [How to Create SSH Keys](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/create-with-openssh/). After generating the key, you can add its fingerprint to the `ssh_keys` attribute in the droplet's configuration as shown above. 

Remember to replace `"YOUR_SSH_KEY_FINGERPRINT"` with the actual fingerprint of your SSH key.
