# Checkov Security Check: CKV_CIRCLECIPIPELINES_3

## What does this check do?

This check, titled "Ensure mutable development orbs are not used", identifies instances where mutable development orbs might be used in CircleCI pipeline configuration. 

An orb in CircleCI is a reusable package of YAML configuration that condenses repeated pieces of configuration into a single line of code. Mutable development orbs are versions of orbs that can be updated and overwritten. They are typically used during the development of an orb and are denoted by "@dev" in their version tag.

The check scans through the configuration dictionary (`conf`), and for each orb in the configuration, it checks if the orb is a string and if the "@dev" tag is present in the orb. If the "@dev" tag is found, the check fails.

## Why is this important?

Using mutable development orbs in production can lead to unpredictable behavior in your CI/CD workflows. Because development orbs can be updated and overwritten, your pipeline might behave differently between runs, even if your configuration hasn't changed. This can make it difficult to troubleshoot and debug issues.

Moreover, from a security perspective, mutable orbs can pose a risk. If an orb is compromised and malicious changes are introduced, those changes could be propagated to your pipelines, potentially leading to a security breach.

## How to fix this issue

To fix this issue, you should avoid using mutable development orbs in your CircleCI pipeline configuration. Instead, you should use immutable production versions of orbs. Immutable orbs are versioned using semantic versioning and cannot be updated or overwritten once published. This ensures a stable and predictable behavior of your pipelines.

In your orb configuration, replace "@dev" with a specific version number. For example, instead of using `circleci/python@dev`, use `circleci/python@1.2.3` where `1.2.3` is the version number of the orb.
