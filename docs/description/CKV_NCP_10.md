# Checkov Security Check: CKV_NCP_10

## Security Issue
This Checkov security check, identified as `CKV_NCP_10`, is designed to identify a potential security misconfiguration related to network access control lists (NACLs) in your infrastructure. Specifically, this check is looking for inbound rules allowing unrestricted access to port 22.

Port 22 is typically used for SSH (Secure Shell) connections which are used for secure remote administration of systems. Allowing unrestricted inbound access to this port could potentially expose your systems to unauthorized access attempts or malicious attacks.

## Security Importance
From a security perspective, this issue is critical. An unrestricted inbound access rule on port 22 can allow any external entity to attempt to establish a SSH connection with your system. This can lead to potential security risks such as unauthorized access, data theft, or even denial-of-service (DoS) attacks if attackers repeatedly attempt connections.

Even if your system uses strong, complex passwords, or key-based authentication, allowing unrestricted access creates unnecessary exposure, and potentially increases the risk of brute-force attacks.

## Fixing the Issue
To fix this issue, you should restrict the inbound access to port 22 to only trusted IP addresses or IP ranges. This can be achieved by modifying the NACLs associated with your network.

In your NACL configuration, ensure that the inbound rule for port 22 is set to allow connections only from trusted sources. These sources could be specific IP addresses or IP ranges from which you expect to receive legitimate SSH connections. 

Remember, security best practices often include minimizing your attack surface by limiting exposure and access wherever possible. Therefore, ensure that only the necessary IPs have access to sensitive ports like 22. This approach follows the principle of least privilege, which is a key concept in information security. If a specific IP doesn't need to connect via SSH, it shouldn't have the permission to do so.
