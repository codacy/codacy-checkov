## Checkov Security Check: CKV_DIO_3

### Security Issue
This Checkov security check, `CKV_DIO_3`, looks for misconfigurations in the Access Control List (ACL) settings of DigitalOcean Spaces buckets. Specifically, it identifies any Spaces buckets that have been configured with `public-read` access.

### Security Implications
The `public-read` ACL setting allows anyone on the internet to read the objects in the Spaces bucket. This means that any data stored in the bucket is publicly accessible, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data leaks, which could be a serious security vulnerability depending on the sensitivity of the data.

### Recommended Fix
To fix this issue, you should set the `acl` attribute of your DigitalOcean Spaces buckets to a value other than `public-read`. It is recommended to use `private` to ensure that only authorized users and services have access to the data stored in the bucket.

In Terraform, you would configure a DigitalOcean Spaces bucket as follows to ensure it is private:

```
resource "digitalocean_spaces_bucket" "example_bucket" {
  name   = "example-bucket"
  region = "nyc3"
  acl    = "private"
}
```

With this configuration, the bucket named `example-bucket` would only be accessible to authorized users and services, thus providing better security for your data.
