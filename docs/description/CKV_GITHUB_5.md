## Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_5

### Security Issue
This Checkov security check, `CKV_GITHUB_5`, identifies a potential security issue where the GitHub branch protection rules allow for force pushes. This rule is defined by the parameter `allow_force_pushes/enabled` in the branch protection rules.

### Why It Matters
The ability to perform force pushes to a GitHub branch can create serious security and stability issues in a code base. A force push effectively rewrites history in the Git repository, replacing old commits with new ones. This can lead to loss of code, overwritten changes, and confusion among team members. 

From a security perspective, if a malicious actor gains access to a contributor's credentials, they could force push malicious code into the repository or erase critical parts of the codebase.

### Fixing the Issue
To fix this issue, you should ensure that the branch protection rules for all important branches do not allow force pushes. This can be done by setting the `allow_force_pushes/enabled` parameter to `False` in the branch protection rules.

In the GitHub UI, you can do this by going to your repository's settings, then to 'Branches' and 'Branch protection rules'. Select the branch rule that you wish to edit or create a new rule. Under the 'Protect matching branches' section, ensure that the 'Allow force pushes' option is unchecked. 

By disallowing force pushes, you will add another layer of security and stability to your GitHub repositories, preventing unauthorized changes and preserving the integrity of your codebase.
