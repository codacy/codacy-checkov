## Checkov Security Check: CKV_NCP_26

### Overview

This Checkov security check, labeled as `CKV_NCP_26`, ensures that an Access Control Group (ACG) has an Access Control Group Rule (ACGR) attached to it. The check is categorized under "NETWORKING".

### Security Issue

The specific issue that this check identifies is the absence of an Access Control Group Rule for an Access Control Group in an ncloud (Naver's cloud computing platform) resource setup. An ACG in ncloud functions similarly to a security group in AWS, acting as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. If an ACG lacks an ACGR, it implies that there are no defined rules to govern the traffic flow, which can expose the cloud resource to potential security threats.

### Security Importance

From a security perspective, this issue is critical. Without an ACGR, an ACG cannot enforce any restrictions on the network traffic to and from the instances associated with it. This could potentially allow unauthorized access to the instances, leading to data leakage, service disruption, or even full control over the instances by malicious entities.

### Solution

The issue can be resolved by ensuring that each Access Control Group has at least one Access Control Group Rule attached to it. This rule will define the type of traffic (by protocol, port, and source or destination) that is allowed or denied by the ACG. 

You can create an ACGR and attach it to an ACG using the ncloud console, SDKs, or APIs. The rule should be carefully crafted, taking into account the principle of least privilege - only the minimum necessary accesses required for the intended functionality should be permitted. Regular audits and updates should be performed to maintain the effectiveness of the rules. 

Please refer to the ncloud documentation for more detailed guidelines on managing ACGs and ACGRs.
