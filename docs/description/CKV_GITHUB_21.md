# Checkov Security Check: CKV_GITHUB_21

## Description

The Checkov security check `CKV_GITHUB_21` identifies whether the creation of public repositories in a GitHub organization is limited to specific members. This is achieved by evaluating the `members_can_create_public_repositories` attribute in the GitHub organization's settings.

## Security Impact

From a security perspective, allowing anyone in an organization to create public repositories can inadvertently expose sensitive information to the public. This includes proprietary code, internal documentation, or configuration files that could be exploited by malicious actors to compromise the system or data.

Furthermore, it could lead to the violation of regulatory compliance rules that mandate data privacy and protection. The disclosure of certain types of data may be against data protection regulations or industry standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS.

## Remediation

To fix this issue, it is recommended to restrict the creation of public repositories to specific members within the organization. This can be done from the organization's settings in GitHub:

1. Navigate to your GitHub organization's settings page.
2. In the left sidebar, click on `Member privileges`.
3. Under `Repository creation`, uncheck the box `Members can create public repositories`.
4. Click on `Save`.

This will prevent members from creating public repositories, reducing the risk of accidental data exposure. Only the organization owners will be able to create public repositories, ensuring that the decision to make a repository public is made consciously and with full awareness of the potential risks.
