## Checkov Security Check: ServerPublicIP (CKV_NCP_23)

### Security Issue or Misconfiguration

The `ServerPublicIP` check identifies a specific misconfiguration where a server instance is assigned a public IP address. This is denoted by the 'ncloud_public_ip' resource in the source code. 

### Security Perspective

From a security perspective, assigning public IP addresses to server instances is risky because it exposes the server to the internet. This could potentially allow hackers to directly communicate with the server, making it more susceptible to attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) or unauthorized access attempts.

### Fixing the Issue

To address this issue, the server instance should not be given a public IP. If the server needs to communicate with the internet, it is safer to do so through a NAT gateway or a load balancer. This way, the server can initiate communication with the internet, but the internet cannot initiate communication with the server. 

This configuration can be achieved within your infrastructure code by not assigning a public IP to the instance and establishing a NAT gateway or load balancer for internet communication instead.

Remember, defense-in-depth is a key strategy in cybersecurity. Avoiding the assignment of public IP addresses to servers is one of the many layers of protection you can use to safeguard your resources.
