# CKV_GITHUB_11: Dismiss Stale Reviews on New Commit

## Issue
This Checkov security check, identified as `CKV_GITHUB_11`, looks for a particular GitHub repository configuration related to pull request reviews. Specifically, it checks whether the repository is configured to dismiss stale reviews upon the submission of a new commit.

A review is considered stale if a new commit is pushed to the branch under review after the review has started. If your repository is not configured to dismiss stale reviews, outdated reviews can remain attached to the code, leading to potential misinterpretations and miscommunications about the current state of the code.

## Security Perspective
From a security perspective, this issue matters because it can contribute to the introduction of vulnerabilities into the codebase. If a developer addresses a code review comment by pushing a new commit but the stale review is not dismissed, other team members might overlook the changes. This could result in the merging of code that has not been properly reviewed against the updated changes, thereby potentially introducing vulnerabilities.

In addition, not dismissing stale reviews could lead to confusion, as developers might think that old issues have not been addressed when they actually have been. This could waste time and resources, and potentially allow other, newer vulnerabilities to slip through the cracks.

## Fix
To address this issue, you need to enable the "Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed" option in your repository's settings. 

In GitHub, you can find this setting by navigating to the main page of the repository, clicking on "Settings", then "Branches", then "Branch protection rules". Here, you can add a rule for the branch you want to protect. Under the "Protect matching branches" section, click on "Require pull request reviews before merging". Then, check the box next to "Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed".
