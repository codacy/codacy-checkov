# Checkov Security Check: NetworkIPsecAlgorithms (CKV_PAN_11)

## Description
The `NetworkIPsecAlgorithms` check ensures that IPsec profiles do not specify the use of insecure encryption algorithms. This check specifically looks for usage of the following encryption algorithms within IPsec profiles:

- DES
- 3DES
- AES-128-CBC
- AES-192-CBC
- AES-256-CBC
- Null

These encryption algorithms are deemed insecure due to various vulnerabilities associated with them, such as susceptibility to known-plaintext attacks (DES), meet-in-the-middle attacks (3DES), and side-channel attacks (AES-CBC modes). The "null" encryption option means no encryption is applied, leaving data unprotected during transmission.

## Importance
Using weak or insecure encryption algorithms for IPsec profiles poses a significant security risk. These algorithms can be easily decrypted, potentially exposing sensitive data to malicious actors. This could lead to unauthorized access to systems, data breaches, and severe reputational and financial damage.

Encrypting network traffic is a critical aspect of securing communication between systems. Using secure and robust encryption algorithms ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it cannot be read or manipulated.

## Remediation
To fix this issue, ensure that your IPsec profiles use secure encryption algorithms. Avoid using the algorithms identified by this check. Instead, use algorithms that are currently considered secure and robust by the security community, such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305.

If the 'encryptions' attribute is not defined in the resource, the Terraform plan stage will fail. Ensure that this attribute is present and includes secure encryption algorithms.

Always keep track of current best practices for encryption and update your configurations as necessary when new vulnerabilities are discovered or when new, more secure encryption algorithms become available.

Remember, the strength of your encryption is often the last line of defense protecting your data during transmission. Always prioritize using the most secure encryption algorithms available.
