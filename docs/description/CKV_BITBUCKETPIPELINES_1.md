# Checkov Security Check: CKV_BITBUCKETPIPELINES_1

## Security Issue
This Checkov security check, identified as `CKV_BITBUCKETPIPELINES_1`, targets a specific misconfiguration in Bitbucket Pipelines where the image in use is tagged as 'latest'. 

The check is defined in the `ImageReferenceLatestTag` class which looks for the value of 'image' in the pipeline configuration dictionary (`conf`). If the image reference ends with `:latest`, the check fails.

## Why It Matters
The `latest` tag in Docker is a mutable tag. This means it does not point to a fixed version of an image, but to the most recent image pushed to a repository. This could lead to inconsistencies and unexpected results in your pipelines as the 'latest' image can vary over time.

Using mutable tags can also pose security issues. If a new image is pushed to the repository with the 'latest' tag, it may contain vulnerabilities that were not present in the previous image. Without a fixed version, it's harder to track and manage these vulnerabilities.

## How to Fix It
To fix this issue, it's recommended to use a specific version tag for your Docker images instead of 'latest'. This ensures that all instances of your pipeline are using the exact same image, maintaining consistency across your deployments. 

In your Bitbucket Pipelines configuration, replace the image tagged as 'latest' with a specific version tag. For example, instead of `myrepo/myimage:latest`, use a specific version like `myrepo/myimage:1.0.1`.

This change helps you maintain control over the exact versions of images used in your pipelines, improving both consistency and security. 

Remember to review and update your image versions regularly to incorporate any security patches or updates.
