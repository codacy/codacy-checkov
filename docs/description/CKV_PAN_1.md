# Checkov Security Check: Zone Protection Profile

This Checkov security check, identified as `CKV_PAN_14`, focuses on the security configuration within certain Security Zones of a network. The specific resources that are evaluated in this check are `panos_zone`, `panos_zone_entry`, and `panos_panorama_zone`.

## Security Issue

The security issue this check identifies is the absence or improper configuration of a Zone Protection Profile within the specified Security Zones. Zone Protection Profiles are used to provide additional security measures for a network beyond the basic security policies. They help to mitigate flood, reconnaissance, and packet-based attack activities. 

In the provided source code, the check specifically looks for the `zone_profile` attribute in the configuration. If this attribute is either not defined or is defined but empty, the check fails, indicating a security misconfiguration.

## Importance from a Security Perspective

From a security perspective, this issue is critical. A Zone Protection Profile is a fundamental part of robust network security. Without it, the network is vulnerable to various types of attacks that could compromise its integrity, confidentiality, and availability. 

A misconfiguration or absence of a Zone Protection Profile could mean that the network is not adequately prepared to defend against or mitigate the impact of potential attacks. This could put sensitive data at risk and disrupt essential operations.

## How to Fix the Issue

To fix this issue, you need to define a Zone Protection Profile within the Security Zones, specifically within the `zone_profile` attribute of the affected resources (`panos_zone`, `panos_zone_entry`, `panos_panorama_zone`). It should not be left as an empty string.

The Zone Protection Profile should be tailored to the network's specific needs and potential threats it might face. By properly configuring the Zone Protection Profile, you can enhance the network's security posture and reduce the likelihood of successful attacks.
