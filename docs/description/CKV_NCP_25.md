# Checkov Security Check: CKV_NCP_25

## Security Issue Identified

This Checkov security check, CKV_NCP_25, is specifically designed to identify a potential misconfiguration in the Access Control Group (ACG) rules of your network. The misconfiguration it targets is the allowance of unrestricted inbound traffic on port 80.

Port 80 is the default port for HTTP traffic. If unrestricted inbound traffic is allowed on this port, it can potentially expose the network to a variety of security threats.

## Importance from a Security Perspective

From a security perspective, this issue is crucial because allowing unrestricted inbound traffic on port 80 can make your network vulnerable to unauthorized access and various types of attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Man-In-The-Middle (MITM), and others.

HTTP traffic is unencrypted, so any data sent over port 80 is in clear text and can be intercepted and read by attackers. To prevent such security risks, it is essential to restrict and control the inbound traffic on port 80.

## How to Fix the Issue

To fix this issue, you should modify the Access Control Group rules to restrict the inbound traffic on port 80. You can do this by specifying a source IP address range that can access port 80, rather than allowing all IP addresses. 

Alternatively, consider using HTTPS (port 443) instead of HTTP (port 80) for your web traffic. HTTPS encrypts the data in transit, providing a more secure connection. 

Remember, the goal is to limit the exposure of your network by reducing the attack surface. Therefore, only trusted IP addresses should be allowed to access important ports such as port 80.
