# IAMOrganizationElevatedMembers Security Check

This security check, IAMOrganizationElevatedMembers, is designed to ensure that an organization member does not have elevated access. The use of IAM or Identity and Access Management is a crucial aspect of any secure system as it involves controlling who is authenticated and authorized to perform actions.

## Issue Identified

Specifically, the IAMOrganizationElevatedMembers check identifies whether any member of an organization has been assigned any of the following roles: "admin", "editor", "organization-manager.organizations.owner", "organization-manager.admin". These roles correspond to elevated access levels that allow users to perform sensitive actions such as modifying system configurations, managing resources, or gaining full access to all resources.

The security check is applicable for the following resources: 

- `yandex_organizationmanager_organization_iam_binding`
- `yandex_organizationmanager_organization_iam_member`

## Importance of this Check

Granting elevated access to organization members can pose a severe security risk. It increases the potential attack surface as each user with elevated privileges can become a potential point of exploitation for attackers. If an attacker compromises a user account with elevated privileges, they can perform malicious actions, such as data theft, deletion of critical resources, or even take over the entire system.

## How to Fix the Issue

To fix the issue, perform a review of the IAM roles within your organization. Ensure that only necessary users have elevated access and that their roles are limited to the specific permissions they require to perform their duties.

To correct any misconfigurations, you need to modify the IAM roles associated with the users from the forbidden values to more suitable roles. This change may involve using less privileged roles or custom roles that only grant the required permissions. 

It's also a best practice to regularly review user permissions and roles, especially those with high levels of access, to ensure that they are still necessary for their job function. This process is a critical component of the principle of least privilege, a security concept where a user is given the minimum levels of access necessary to complete their tasks. 

In conclusion, maintaining strict controls over IAM roles and ensuring that the principle of least privilege is adhered to is a critical aspect of maintaining a secure system.
